Points: 5

Solve:
Our security manager, Julius, is confident nobody can break his encryption and so left the flag for everyone to see. [ciphered_flag.txt](https://challenge.acictf.com/static/3e139bd0f1aabc671965f689eaf9bdf1/ciphered_flag.txt)

Hint:

Does knowing the flag format give you any information about how the flag was encrypted?
When in [Rome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher)?
Julius is notorious for playing games with the problem names...

Steps:

Cipher text starts with "IKQ" but know we are looking for "ACI". "A" to "I" is an 8 charachter shift. can solve at [dcode.fr](https://www.dcode.fr/caesar-cipher) in a browser. 

Flag: <!-- ACI{CrYpTo_FuN_fOr_AlL_KujxdgjF} -->
