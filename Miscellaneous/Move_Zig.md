# Move Zig

Points: 75

Solve:
CATS is back at it on [challenge.acictf.com:55349](https://challenge.acictf.com:55349). Only this time he's throwing 500 problems at you. If you didn't use a program to solve the last one, you'll probably want [this](https://challenge.acictf.com/static/ac3db35d74529567871876d0b4408c43/starter_code.py)...

Hint:

We'll be impressed if you solve this without writing code. The hints on 'All Your Base Are Belong to Us' are still relevant here as well.

Steps:

Python code to convert the input and output. Same code as [All You Base Are Belong to Us](https://github.com/adstannard/ACI-CTF-CyberStake2020/blob/master/Miscellaneous/All_Your_Base_Are_Belong_to_Us.md)

Notes:

Code worked forst time as had been fixed for previous challenge
