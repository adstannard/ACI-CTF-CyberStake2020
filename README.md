# ACI-CTF-CyberStake2020
## Army Cyber Institute Capture The Flag CyberStakes 2020 Write up

This was my first Capture The Flag (CTF) event and therefore my first CTF write up. A key aim of taking part in the [ACI CTF](https://cyberstakes.acictf.com/news) was to learn something new and therefore I'm creating the writ-ups to consolidate my learning following the [Feynman Technique](https://mattyford.com/blog/2014/1/23/the-feynman-technique-model) of recapping and summarising what I have learnt. The aim is to expain the challenge solutions as though they are for someone else.

What is the ACI CTF CyberStakes 2020?

The **Army Cyber Institute Capture The Flag CyberStakes 2020** ran for 10 days from Friday 24 April 2020 to Sunday 3 May 2020.

There were a total of [73 challenges](https://cyberstakes.acictf.com/problems) broken down into 7 categories. A CTF with categories is know as _Jepardy Style_ after the US television quiz show. No requirement to answer with questions, just that there are different categories:

* Tutorial              (6 challenges)
* Miscellaneous         (12 challenges)
* Web Security          (11 challenges)
* Cryptography          (7 challenges)
* Forensics             (12 challenges)
* Reverse Engineering   (11 challenges)
* Binary Exploitation   (11 challenges)

Challenges were not all visible at first but became reveild as the Tutorial was completed and then eaiser challenges reveiled harder challenges in each category upon completion. The CTF was put back up after the competition in training mode.
