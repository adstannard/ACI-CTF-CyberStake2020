##Army Cyber Institute Capture The Flag CyberStakes 2020 Write up

This was my first Capture The Flag (CTF) event and therefore my first CTF write up. A key aim of taking part in the [ACI CTF](https://cyberstakes.acictf.com/news) was to learn something new and therefore I'm creating the writ-ups to consolidate my learning following the [Feynman Technique](https://mattyford.com/blog/2014/1/23/the-feynman-technique-model) of recapping and summarising what I have learnt. The aim is to expain the challenge solutions as though they are for someone else.

What is the ACI CTF CyberStakes 2020?

The **Army Cyber Institute Capture The Flag CyberStakes 2020** ran for 10 days from Friday 24 April 2020 to Sunday 3 May 2020.

There were a total of [73 challenges](https://cyberstakes.acictf.com/problems) broken down into 7 categories. A CTF with categories is know as _Jepardy Style_ after the US television quiz show. No requirement to answer with questions, just that there are different categories:

* Tutorial
* Miscellaneous
* Web Security
* Cryptography
* Forensics
* Reverse Engineering
* Binary Exploitation

The CTF was put back up after the competition in training mode.
