# Download Me

Points: 3

Solve:\
We know, we know. We ask you to practice good cyber hygiene and now we're asking you to download random files from our site like [this](https://challenge.acictf.com/static/211b91feeda5b9cb7306da12ffe2fffb/flag) one. We promise none of these files contain actual malware that could harm your computer.\

Hints:\
How can you look at a file with no extension?\
Command line tools like `file` and `cat` are useful (try typing `file --help` in a terminal for more info on what it does).
Using Windows and don't have access to `bash`? We've got you [covered](https://cyberstakes.acictf.com/shell). You may also be surprised what's [available](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about) in Windows. Sometimes though `Notepad` is good enough...

Steps:\
Download the file and read in a text editor.

Notes:\
Also links to the shell available to access `bash`.
