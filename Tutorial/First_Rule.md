# First Rule

Points: 1

Solve:\
In light of the current situation, we feel it is important to talk about CTF best practices for participating in All-Army CyberStakes. First, you should learn to recognize what a flag looks like. They will look along the lines of 'ACI{...}' (unless a problem says otherwise). Upon contact with a flag you should immediately "sanitize" it by pasting it into the problem's submission form and hitting submit. Let's practice with this one: `ACI{this_is_a_flag}`.
Hints:\
Please stay safe and practice good physical and [cyber](https://www.arcyber.army.mil/Info/Fact-Sheets/Fact-Sheet-View-Page/Article/1425566/cybersecurity-fact-sheet-10-cybersecurity-tips/) hygiene.

Steps:
Copy and paste!

Flag: <!-- ACI{this_is_a_flag} -->
