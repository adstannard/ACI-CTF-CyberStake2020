Social Distancing for Challenges! After reading about how social distancing helps prevent the spread of diseases, we realized we can do the same thing with our challenges so that if you bork a database, you don't hurt other competitors in the process. We are proud to present **Socially Distanced Challenges** - now our hacking challenges can experience the same fun as us! Go read our [distancing guidance](https://acictf.com/distancing/) to find out more (yes, yes there is a flag there).
