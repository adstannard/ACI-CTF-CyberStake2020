Solve:
The flag submission system lets us see the strings you submitted even when they're wrong. Since some of you may consider that a privacy issue, we decided to demo a flag validation system that checks it client-side before sending the flag to us for checking. Why don't you give it a try: `http://challenge.acictf.com:11498`


Hint:

How does your browser know what the right key is to do the check?
If only there were a way to `control+U`'re view of what the server sent you.

Steps:

Inspect the page source in your browser. Used Safari so `Command + Option + U`. In the _Sources_ tab just copy and paste.
